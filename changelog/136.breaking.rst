Made the following functions in `sunkit_image.trace` private:

1. ``curvature_radius`` (renamed to ``_curvature_radius``)
2. ``erase_loop_in_image`` (renamed to ``_erase_loop_in_image``)
3. ``initial_direction_finding`` (renamed to ``_initial_direction_finding``)
4. ``loop_add`` (renamed to ``_loop_add``)

These were never intended to be used by users but for the user-facing functions.
